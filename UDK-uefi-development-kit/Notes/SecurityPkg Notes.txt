================================================================================
                            NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES
================================================================================
1. UEFI 2.5 new features
    1)  Implement PKCS7 Verify Protocol in PKCS7VerifyDxe.
        (NOTE: The VerifySignature interface is not supported in this version,
         due to openssl interface limitation).
    2)  Implement HASH2 Protocol in HASH2DxeCrypto, including Hash2 Service
        Binding Protocol and Hash2 Protocol.

2. Authenticated variable and secure boot
    1)  Implement variable quota management to prevent NV variable resource
        draining under DOS attack. PcdMaxUserNvVariableSpaceSize &
        PcdBoottimeReservedNvVariableSpaceSize are introduced to control this
        feature.
    2)  Implement VarCheck PROTOCOL. Specific variable check will be performed
        before setting variable.
    3)  Allow delete operation to common auth variable with the indication of
        user physical presence.
    4)  Remove VariableDxe/Pei/Info module from SecurityPkg. Move auth variable
        service into AuthVariableLib library. Variable logic become common.
    5)  Support RFC3161 timestamp countersignature checking in image verification.
        It is an UEFI 2.4 feature.
    6)  Other bug fixes and enhancements:
        a) Make time based AuthVariable update atomic
        b) Make PK & SecureBootMode state consistent
        c) Reuse scratch data area(at the end of volatile variable store) as
           serialization runtime buffer to reduce SMRAM consumption in SMM
           variable driver
        d) Support PcdMaxAuthVariableSize for auth variable
        e) Update SecureBootConfigDxe to support ARM or AARCH64 image digest
           enrollment

3. TCG TPM
    1)  Add >=128 operation value support in TPM Physical Presence, OEM can
        create OemPpVendorLib to handle >=128 operation value.
    2)  Add TpmInitializationDonePpi to TPM PEI module.
    3)  Add TPM2 commands which can be used for field upgrade, provision and NV
        related function.
    4)  Add UEFI TPM2 support defined by trusted computing group. Spec version is
        TCG EFI Protocol Specification for TPM Family 2.0 Revision 1.0 Version 9
        TCG Physical Presence Interface Specification Version 1.30, Revision 00.52
    5)  Change TPM MMIO range attribute for TCG spec compliance.
    6)  Other bug fixes and enhancements
        a) Add error check in Tcg/TrEE Pei/Dxe module to avoid unnecessary
           hardware check for performance optimization
        b) Handle TPM device error and avoid deadloop
        c) Correct the variable measurement behavior to include whole EFI_VARIABLE_DATA
           structure
        d) Remove redundant ASSERT in TcgDxe & TreeDxe. Some asserts are removed
           directly, some are replaced by debug output

4. Misc
    1)  Add Secure MOR lock feature. Variable MemoryOverwriteRequestControl is
        added to defend against new threats.
    2)  Add TPer Reset operation common logic to TcgMor module. The logic is called
        on EndOfDxe event.

================================================================================
                            PACKAGE INTERFACE CHANGES
================================================================================
1. Auth VariableDxe/Pei/Info modules are removed from SecurityPkg. New auth variable
   solution is to use corresponding modules in MdeModulePkg plus AuthVariableLib.

2. Tcg2PpVendorLib library class is added. OEM/IHV can implement specific library
   instance to support >=128 operation value in TPM Physical Presence.

3. New Tcg2 modules are added to support Tcg TPM 2.0 & Physical Presence 1.3 spec,
   including Tcg2Pei/Dxe/Smm, Dxe/Pei/SmmTcg2PhysicalPresenceLib, Tpm2DeviceLib.
   TrEE ones can be replaced.

4. New guid gTcgEvent2EntryHobGuid, gTpmErrorHobGuid, gEfiTcg2PhysicalPresenceGuid,
   gTcg2ConfigFormSetGuid are added for Tcg2.0 & TPM performance enhancement.

5. New ppi gPeiTpmInitializationDonePpi is added to indicate that TPM initialization
   is done.

6. Header file changes
   1) TpmMeasurementLib.h is moved to MdeModulePkg/Include/Library
   2) gEfiAuthenticatedVariableGuid definition is moved to mdemodulepkg/include/guid/
      VariableFormat.h

7. PCD changes
   1) PcdTpm2HashMask attribute is changed to PcdsDynamic, PcdsDynamicEx.
   2) PcdTcg2HashAlgorithmBitmap is added to indicated final BIOS supported Hash
      algorithm.
   3) PcdStatusCodeSubClassTpmDevice is added to define Progress Code for TPM device
      subclass definitions.
   4) PcdTcg2NumberOfPCRBanks is added for OEM to configure PCR banks number.
