                            NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES
================================================================================
1. Add following new modules to support HTTP boot defined in UEFI 2.5.
   1) HTTP boot driver
      Module INF: NetworkPkg\HttpBootDxe\HttpBootDxe.inf
      This module produces the EFI Load File Protocol which implements UEFI HTTP
      boot capability over IPv4.
   2) HTTP driver
      Module INF: NetworkPkg\HttpDxe\HttpDxe.inf
      This module produces the EFI HTTP Service Binding Protocol and EFI HTTP
      Portocol, only IPv4 network stack is supported.
   3) HTTP utilities driver
      Module INF: NetworkPkg\HttpUtilitiesDxe\HttpUtilitiesDxe.inf
      This module produces the EFI HTTP Utilities Protocol.
   4) DNS driver
      Module INF: NetworkPkg\DnsDxe\DnsDxe.inf
      This module produces the EFI DNS4 & DNS6 Service Binding Protocol and EFI
      DNS4 & DNS6 Protocol.
2. Remove the EFI_IP4_CONFIG_PROTOCOL dependency from the EDKII network stack.
3. PXE Update
   1) Support PXE boot cross subnet on IPv6 network.
   2) Update the parameter check of EFI_PXE_BASE_CODE_PROTOCOL.UdpRead() to
      align with spec definition.
   3) Check UNDI driver's IPv6 compatibility before start PXE boot over IPv6
      network.
   4) Check the input FilePath parameter of EFI_LOAD_FILE_PROTOCOL.LoadFile() to
      see whether it's a supported devcie path before start PXE boot.
   5) Fix a bug that a failed PXEv6 after a success PXEv4 may cause ASSERT.
   6) Fix a bug that the EFI_PXE_BASE_CODE_PROTOCOL.Dhcp() may return incorrect
      status code if the DHCP process has completed.
4. DHCPv6 Update
   1) Add a new PCD to allow the platform to control the default DUID format.
   2) Fix a bug that the driver may produce incorrect DUID-LLT Client Identifier.
   3) Fix a bug that the driver won't process more message if receive a DHCP
      message with unrecognized Xid field.
5. iSCSI Update
   1) Fix a bug that the driver incorrectly returning EFI_SUCCESS for a child it
      doesn't own for EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL/EFI_COMPONENT_NAME2_PROTOCOL.
   2) Check the format of IPv4 and IPv6 device path node to see whether it contains
      the new added field in UEFI Specification.
6. TCP Update
   1) Fix a bug that the driver will reply an ACK with a TSecr=0 which may be
      rejected by TCP server during 3-way handshake.
7. IPv6 Update
   1) Fix the DAD fail issue when user changing the IP configuration policy or
      setting a same IPv6 address before the previous DAD is finished.
   2) Locate IPsec protocol on IP package processing only if it has installed
      for performance enhancement.
8. IPSec Update
   1) Fix a reconnect hang issue when IPSec has set up.
   2) Fix a hang issue when setting a SPD entry in IPSec database.

                            PACKAGE INTERFACE CHANGES
================================================================================
1. New added network stack modules.
     NetworkPkg\HttpBootDxe\HttpBootDxe.inf
     NetworkPkg\HttpDxe\HttpDxe.inf
     NetworkPkg\HttpUtilitiesDxe\HttpUtilitiesDxe.inf
     NetworkPkg\DnsDxe\DnsDxe.inf
   The HttpDxe and HttpBootDxe consumes new added library HttpLib.
2. A new PCD PcdDhcp6UidType is defined in NetworkPkg.dec to allow platform to
   set the default IPv6 DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) Type.

================================================================================
                      UEFI/PI SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE
================================================================================
1. Add new protocol support in UEFI 2.5.
     EFI_HTTP_SERVICE_BINDING_PROTOCOL (Only support IPv4 network stack now)
     EFI_HTTP_PROTOCOL (Only support IPv4 network stack now)
     EFI_HTTP_UTILITIES_PROTOCOL
     EFI_DNS4_SERVICE_BINDING_PROTOCOL
     EFI_DNS4_PROTOCOL
     EFI_DNS6_SERVICE_BINDING_PROTOCOL
     EFI_DNS6_PROTOCOL
2. In UEFI 2.5, the EFI_IP4_CONFIG_PROTOCOL is marked to be deprecated in next
   revision of UEFI specification, a new protocol EFI_IP4_CONFIG2_PROTOCOL is
   defined. All EDKII network stack modules have been updated to use the new
   protocol and remove the dependency on the old one.

================================================================================
                            INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
================================================================================
1. This version of EDK2 network stack modules can't work with the network drivers
   in previous release version. For example, there was an Ip4ConfigDxe driver in
   previous release of MdeModulePkg which has been removed in this release, and
   all EDK2 network stank modules can't work with it now.

================================================================================
                               KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================
1. iSCSI remote OS installation/boot with IPsec enabled.
   In the current implementation, iSCSI driver is capable to access the storage
   server in pre-OS environment when IPsec is enabled; while iSCSI remote OS
   installation/boot cannot work with IPsec since the IPsec required parameters
   are not conveyed to operating system. One possible way to handover such parameters
   to the operating system is to use the GUIDed device path.

2. Reenter an "UEFI Http" boot option in "Boot Manager Menu" will fail and go back
   to the same page directly. This is because BDS couldn't find a proper boot device
   after the device path updated by HTTP boot driver in pervious HTTP boot. To restart
   HTTP boot, user need to exit and reenter the "Boot Manager Menu" or reset the
   platform.
